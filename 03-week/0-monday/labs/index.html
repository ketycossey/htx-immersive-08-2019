       <p> In mathematics, a conic section (or simply conic) is a curve obtained as the intersection of the surface of a cone with a plane. The three types of conic section are the hyperbola, the parabola, and the ellipse; the circle is a special case of the ellipse, though historically it was sometimes called a fourth type. The ancient Greek mathematicians 
           studied conic sections, culminating around 200 BC with Apollonius of
            Perga's systematic work on their properties.     </p>
